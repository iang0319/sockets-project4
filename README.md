# Movement Pro - Project 4
#### Goal: 
# An app that uses sockets to send workout information

#### Audience:
# Our audience includes users who enjoy working out together. This could include something as simple as a group of friends, or as complex as a sports team. The idea is that the app will be able to bring people together to help them grow physically through accountability of other people.

#### Functionality:
# Our app allows the user to create or join workouts. If the user chooses to create a workout, they will be able to build what exercise, set, and reps the participants of the workout should do. If a user chooses to join a workout, they will be able to make a connection with someone who built a workout, and be able to follow along with the workout they created.

#### Usefulness:
# Our app allows for users to be held accountable for their workout progress, as well as to join in on other peoples workouts if you are not comfortable with creating your own. The sky is the limit for the ability of this app to help people on their fitness journey. It allows an aspect for people with exeprience working out to help people that are beginning their journey.
